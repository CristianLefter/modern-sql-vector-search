## How to contribute

2. Make your changes.  
3. Run the quick checks locally (formatting/lint).  
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) with a clear description and screenshots if applicable.

## Code style

- Keep SQL scripts readable and commented.
- Keep Python files formatted with `black` and `ruff` (optional).
- Small, focused PRs are easier to review.
